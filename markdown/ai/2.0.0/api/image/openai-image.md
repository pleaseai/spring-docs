# OpenAI Image Generation

Spring AI supports DALL-E, the Image generation model from OpenAI.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting from version `2.0.0-M5`, Spring AI uses the official `openai-java` SDK under the hood for all OpenAI models. The transition is expected to be seamless and there are no breaking changes for existing users of the OpenAI API properties and builders. If you find any issues, please report them to us at [Spring AI GitHub Issues](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/issues).

<a id="_prerequisites"></a>

## Prerequisites

You will need to create an API key with OpenAI to access ChatGPT models.

Create an account at [OpenAI signup page](https://platform.openai.com/signup) and generate the token on the [API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

The Spring AI project defines a configuration property named `spring.ai.openai.api-key` that you should set to the value of the `API Key` obtained from openai.com.

You can set this configuration property in your `application.properties` file:

```properties
spring.ai.openai.api-key=<your-openai-api-key>
```

For enhanced security when handling sensitive information like API keys, you can use Spring Expression Language (SpEL) to reference a custom environment variable:

```yaml
# In application.yml
spring:
  ai:
    openai:
      api-key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
```

```bash
# In your environment or .env file
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
```

You can also set this configuration programmatically in your application code:

```java
// Retrieve API key from a secure source or environment variable
String apiKey = System.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY");
```

## Auto-configuration

> [!NOTE]
> There has been a significant change in the Spring AI auto-configuration, starter modules' artifact names.
> Please refer to the [upgrade notes](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/upgrade-notes.html) for more information.

Spring AI provides Spring Boot auto-configuration for the OpenAI Image Generation Client.
To enable it add the following dependency to your project’s Maven `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-ai-starter-model-openai</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

or to your Gradle `build.gradle` build file.

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.ai:spring-ai-starter-model-openai'
}
```

> [!TIP]
> Refer to the [Dependency Management](../../getting-started.md#dependency-management) section to add the Spring AI BOM to your build file.

<a id="_configuration_properties"></a>

#### Configuration Properties

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling and disabling of the image auto-configurations are now configured via top level properties with the prefix `spring.ai.model.image`.
>
> To enable, spring.ai.model.image=openai (It is enabled by default)
>
> To disable, spring.ai.model.image=none (or any value which doesn’t match openai)
>
> This change is done to allow configuration of multiple models.

The prefix `spring.ai.openai.image` is the property prefix that lets you configure the `ImageModel` implementation for OpenAI.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Property | Description | Default |
| spring.ai.openai.image.enabled (Removed and no longer valid) | Enable OpenAI image model. | true |
| spring.ai.model.image | Enable OpenAI image model. | openai |
| spring.ai.openai.image.base-url | Optional overrides the spring.ai.openai.base-url to provide chat specific url | - |
| spring.ai.openai.image.api-key | Optional overrides the spring.ai.openai.api-key to provide chat specific api-key | - |
| spring.ai.openai.image.organization-id | Optionally you can specify which organization  used for an API request. | - |
| spring.ai.openai.image.project-id | Optionally, you can specify which project is used for an API request. | - |

> [!NOTE]
> You can override the common `spring.ai.openai.base-url`, `spring.ai.openai.api-key`, `spring.ai.openai.organization-id` and `spring.ai.openai.project-id` properties.
> The `spring.ai.openai.image.base-url`, `spring.ai.openai.image.api-key`, `spring.ai.openai.image.organization-id` and `spring.ai.openai.image.project-id` properties if set take precedence over the common properties.
> This is useful if you want to use different OpenAI accounts for different models and different model endpoints.

> [!TIP]
> All properties prefixed with `spring.ai.openai.image.options` can be overridden at runtime.

<a id="image-options"></a>

## Runtime Options

The [OpenAiImageOptions.java](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/models/spring-ai-openai/src/main/java/org/springframework/ai/openai/OpenAiImageOptions.java) provides model configurations, such as the model to use, the quality, the size, etc.

On start-up, the default options can be configured by passing `OpenAiImageOptions` to the `OpenAiImageModel` constructor. Alternatively, use the `spring.ai.openai.image.*` properties described previously.

At runtime you can override the default options by adding new, request specific, options to the `ImagePrompt` call.
For example to override the OpenAI specific options such as quality and the number of images to create, use the following code example:

```java
ImageResponse response = openaiImageModel.call(
        new ImagePrompt("A light cream colored mini golden doodle",
        OpenAiImageOptions.builder()
                .quality("hd")
                .n(4)
                .height(1024)
                .width(1024).build())

);
```

> [!TIP]
> In addition to the model specific [OpenAiImageOptions](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/models/spring-ai-openai/src/main/java/org/springframework/ai/openai/OpenAiImageOptions.java) you can use a portable [ImageOptions](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/spring-ai-model/src/main/java/org/springframework/ai/image/ImageOptions.java) instance, created with the [ImageOptionsBuilder#builder()](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/blob/main/spring-ai-model/src/main/java/org/springframework/ai/image/ImageOptionsBuilder.java).

<a id="_customizing_the_http_client"></a>

## Customizing the HTTP Client

Spring AI uses the official `openai-java` SDK under the hood and configures its HTTP transport with a custom OkHttp client built by `SpringAiOpenAiHttpClient.Builder`.
You can intercept that builder before the underlying `OkHttpClient` is created by exposing one or more `OpenAiHttpClientBuilderCustomizer` beans.
Each customizer receives the same builder used by every OpenAI model (chat, embedding, image, audio, moderation), so the customization applies uniformly.

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface OpenAiHttpClientBuilderCustomizer {
    void customize(SpringAiOpenAiHttpClient.Builder builder);
}
```

Typical use cases include:

- registering OkHttp `Interceptor` instances (authentication, propagation headers, custom logging);
- swapping the dispatcher `ExecutorService` (for example, to route async I/O through virtual threads);
- configuring proxy, SSL, hostname verification, or the connection-pool sizing exposed by the builder.

When several customizers are present, they are applied in `@Order` / `Ordered` order, after Spring AI’s own defaults, so user code wins.

The same hook is available when wiring a model manually via the `OpenAi*Model.Builder`:

```java
var chatModel = OpenAiChatModel.builder()
    .options(OpenAiChatOptions.builder().model("gpt-4o").build())
    .httpClientBuilderCustomizer(myCustomizer)
    .build();
```
