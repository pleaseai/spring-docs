# Building Effective Agents

In a recent research publication, [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents), Anthropic shared valuable insights about building effective Large Language Model (LLM) agents. What makes this research particularly interesting is its emphasis on simplicity and composability over complex frameworks. Let’s explore how these principles translate into practical implementations using [Spring AI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/index.html).

![Agent Systems](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/v1.0.6/spring-ai-docs/src/main/antora/modules/ROOT/images/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-io/spring-io-static/refs/heads/main/blog/tzolov/spring-ai-agentic-systems.jpg)

While the pattern descriptions and diagrams are sourced from Anthropic’s original publication, we’ll focus on how to implement these patterns using Spring AI’s features for model portability and structured output. We recommend reading the original paper first.

The [agentic-patterns](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/tree/main/agentic-patterns) directory in the spring-ai-examples repository contains all the code for the examples that follow.

## Agentic Systems

The research publication makes an important architectural distinction between two types of agentic systems:

1. **Workflows**: Systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths (e.g., prescriptive systems)
1. **Agents**: Systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage

The key insight is that while fully autonomous agents might seem appealing, workflows often provide better predictability and consistency for well-defined tasks. This aligns perfectly with enterprise requirements where reliability and maintainability are crucial.

Let’s examine how Spring AI implements these concepts through five fundamental patterns, each serving specific use cases:

<a id="_1_chain_workflow"></a>

### 1. [Chain Workflow](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/tree/main/agentic-patterns/chain-workflow)

The Chain Workflow pattern exemplifies the principle of breaking down complex tasks into simpler, more manageable steps.

![Prompt Chaining Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/v1.0.6/spring-ai-docs/src/main/antora/modules/ROOT/images/https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F7418719e3dab222dccb379b8879e1dc08ad34c78-2401x1000.png&w=3840&q=75)

**When to Use:**
- Tasks with clear sequential steps
- When you want to trade latency for higher accuracy
- When each step builds on the previous step’s output

Here’s a practical example from Spring AI’s implementation:

```java
public class ChainWorkflow {
    private final ChatClient chatClient;
    private final String[] systemPrompts;

    public String chain(String userInput) {
        String response = userInput;
        for (String prompt : systemPrompts) {
            String input = String.format("{%s}\n {%s}", prompt, response);
            response = chatClient.prompt(input).call().content();
        }
        return response;
    }
}
```

This implementation demonstrates several key principles:

- Each step has a focused responsibility
- Output from one step becomes input for the next
- The chain is easily extensible and maintainable

### 2. [Parallelization Workflow](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/tree/main/agentic-patterns/parallelization-workflow)

LLMs can work simultaneously on tasks and have their outputs aggregated programmatically.

![Parallelization Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/v1.0.6/spring-ai-docs/src/main/antora/modules/ROOT/images/https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F406bb032ca007fd1624f261af717d70e6ca86286-2401x1000.png&w=3840&q=75)

**When to Use:**
- Processing large volumes of similar but independent items
- Tasks requiring multiple independent perspectives
- When processing time is critical and tasks are parallelizable

```java
List<String> parallelResponse = new ParallelizationWorkflow(chatClient)
    .parallel(
        "Analyze how market changes will impact this stakeholder group.",
        List.of(
            "Customers: ...",
            "Employees: ...",
            "Investors: ...",
            "Suppliers: ..."
        ),
        4
    );
```

<a id="_3_routing_workflow"></a>

### 3. [Routing Workflow](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/tree/main/agentic-patterns/routing-workflow)

The Routing pattern implements intelligent task distribution, enabling specialized handling for different types of input.

![Routing Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/v1.0.6/spring-ai-docs/src/main/antora/modules/ROOT/images/https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F5c0c0e9fe4def0b584c04d37849941da55e5e71c-2401x1000.png&w=3840&q=75)

**When to Use:**
- Complex tasks with distinct categories of input
- When different inputs require specialized processing
- When classification can be handled accurately

```java
@Autowired
private ChatClient chatClient;

RoutingWorkflow workflow = new RoutingWorkflow(chatClient);

Map<String, String> routes = Map.of(
    "billing", "You are a billing specialist. Help resolve billing issues...",
    "technical", "You are a technical support engineer. Help solve technical problems...",
    "general", "You are a customer service representative. Help with general inquiries..."
);

String input = "My account was charged twice last week";
String response = workflow.route(input, routes);
```

<a id="_4_orchestrator_workers"></a>

### 4. [Orchestrator-Workers](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/tree/main/agentic-patterns/orchestrator-workers)

![Orchestration Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/v1.0.6/spring-ai-docs/src/main/antora/modules/ROOT/images/https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8985fc683fae4780fb34eab1365ab78c7e51bc8e-2401x1000.png&w=3840&q=75)

**When to Use:**
- Complex tasks where subtasks can’t be predicted upfront
- Tasks requiring different approaches or perspectives
- Situations needing adaptive problem-solving

```java
public class OrchestratorWorkersWorkflow {
    public WorkerResponse process(String taskDescription) {
        // 1. Orchestrator analyzes task and determines subtasks
        OrchestratorResponse orchestratorResponse = // ...

        // 2. Workers process subtasks in parallel
        List<String> workerResponses = // ...

        // 3. Results are combined into final response
        return new WorkerResponse(/*...*/);
    }
}
```

Usage Example:

```java
ChatClient chatClient = // ... initialize chat client
OrchestratorWorkersWorkflow workflow = new OrchestratorWorkersWorkflow(chatClient);

WorkerResponse response = workflow.process(
    "Generate both technical and user-friendly documentation for a REST API endpoint"
);

System.out.println("Analysis: " + response.analysis());
System.out.println("Worker Outputs: " + response.workerResponses());
```

<a id="_5_evaluator_optimizer"></a>

### 5. [Evaluator-Optimizer](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/tree/main/agentic-patterns/evaluator-optimizer)

![Evaluator-Optimizer Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-projects/spring-ai/v1.0.6/spring-ai-docs/src/main/antora/modules/ROOT/images/https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F14f51e6406ccb29e695da48b17017e899a6119c7-2401x1000.png&w=3840&q=75)

**When to Use:**
- Clear evaluation criteria exist
- Iterative refinement provides measurable value
- Tasks benefit from multiple rounds of critique

```java
public class EvaluatorOptimizerWorkflow {
    public RefinedResponse loop(String task) {
        Generation generation = generate(task, context);
        EvaluationResponse evaluation = evaluate(generation.response(), task);
        return new RefinedResponse(finalSolution, chainOfThought);
    }
}
```

Usage Example:

```java
ChatClient chatClient = // ... initialize chat client
EvaluatorOptimizerWorkflow workflow = new EvaluatorOptimizerWorkflow(chatClient);

RefinedResponse response = workflow.loop(
    "Create a Java class implementing a thread-safe counter"
);

System.out.println("Final Solution: " + response.solution());
System.out.println("Evolution: " + response.chainOfThought());
```
