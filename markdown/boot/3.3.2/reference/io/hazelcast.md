# Hazelcast

If [Hazelcast](https://hazelcast.com/) is on the classpath and a suitable configuration is found, Spring Boot auto-configures a `HazelcastInstance` that you can inject in your application.

Spring Boot first attempts to create a client by checking the following configuration options:

- The presence of a `com.hazelcast.client.config.ClientConfig` bean.
- A configuration file defined by the `spring.hazelcast.config` property.
- The presence of the `hazelcast.client.config` system property.
- A `hazelcast-client.xml` in the working directory or at the root of the classpath.
- A `hazelcast-client.yaml` (or `hazelcast-client.yml`) in the working directory or at the root of the classpath.

If a client can not be created, Spring Boot attempts to configure an embedded server.
If you define a `com.hazelcast.config.Config` bean, Spring Boot uses that.
If your configuration defines an instance name, Spring Boot tries to locate an existing instance rather than creating a new one.

You could also specify the Hazelcast configuration file to use through configuration, as shown in the following example:

#### Properties

```properties
spring.hazelcast.config=classpath:config/my-hazelcast.xml
```

#### YAML

```yaml
spring:
  hazelcast:
    config: "classpath:config/my-hazelcast.xml"
```

Otherwise, Spring Boot tries to find the Hazelcast configuration from the default locations: `hazelcast.xml` in the working directory or at the root of the classpath, or a YAML counterpart in the same locations.
We also check if the `hazelcast.config` system property is set.
See the [Hazelcast documentation](https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/) for more details.

> [!TIP]
> By default, `@SpringAware` on Hazelcast components is supported.
> The `ManagementContext` can be overridden by declaring a `HazelcastConfigCustomizer` bean with an `@Order` higher than zero.

> [!NOTE]
> Spring Boot also has [explicit caching support for Hazelcast](caching.md#io.caching.provider.hazelcast).
> If caching is enabled, the `HazelcastInstance` is automatically wrapped in a `CacheManager` implementation.
