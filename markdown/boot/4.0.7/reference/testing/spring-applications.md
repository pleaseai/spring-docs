# Testing Spring Applications

One of the major advantages of dependency injection is that it should make your code easier to unit test.
You can instantiate objects by using the `new` operator without even involving Spring.
You can also use *mock objects* instead of real dependencies.

Often, you need to move beyond unit testing and start integration testing (with a Spring [`ApplicationContext`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ApplicationContext.html)).
It is useful to be able to perform integration testing without requiring deployment of your application or needing to connect to other infrastructure.

The Spring Framework includes a dedicated test module for such integration testing.
You can declare a dependency directly to `org.springframework:spring-test` or use the `spring-boot-starter-test` starter to pull it in transitively.

If you have not used the `spring-test` module before, you should start by reading the [relevant section](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/7.0/testing.html) of the Spring Framework reference documentation.
