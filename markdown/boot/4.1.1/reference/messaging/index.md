# Messaging

The Spring Framework provides extensive support for integrating with messaging systems, from simplified use of the JMS API using [`JmsClient`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/core/JmsClient.html) to a complete infrastructure to receive messages asynchronously.
Spring AMQP provides a similar feature set for the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol.
Spring Boot also provides auto-configuration options for [`RabbitTemplate`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-amqp/docs/4.1.x/api/org/springframework/amqp/rabbit/core/RabbitTemplate.html) and RabbitMQ.
Spring WebSocket natively includes support for STOMP messaging, and Spring Boot has support for that through starters and a small amount of auto-configuration.
Spring Boot also has support for Apache Kafka and Apache Pulsar.
