# Externalized Configuration

Spring Boot lets you externalize your configuration so that you can work with the same application code in different environments.
You can use a variety of external configuration sources including Java properties files, YAML files, environment variables, and command-line arguments.

Property values can be injected directly into your beans by using the [`@Value`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Value.html) annotation, accessed through Spring’s [`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html) abstraction, or be [bound to structured objects](#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties) through [`@ConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html).

Spring Boot uses a very particular [`PropertySource`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/PropertySource.html) order that is designed to allow sensible overriding of values.
Later property sources can override the values defined in earlier ones.

<a id="features.external-config.order"></a>

Sources are considered in the following order:

1. Default properties (specified by setting [`SpringApplication.setDefaultProperties(Map)`](<https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/SpringApplication.html#setDefaultProperties(java.util.Map)>)).
1. [`@PropertySource`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/PropertySource.html) annotations on your [`@Configuration`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Configuration.html) classes.
Please note that such property sources are not added to the [`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html) until the application context is being refreshed.
This is too late to configure certain properties such as `logging.*` and `spring.main.*` which are read before refresh begins.
1. Config data (such as `application.properties` files).
1. A [`RandomValuePropertySource`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/env/RandomValuePropertySource.html) that has properties only in `random.*`.
1. OS environment variables.
1. Java System properties (`System.getProperties()`).
1. JNDI attributes from `java:comp/env`.
1. [`ServletContext`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/6.1/apidocs/jakarta.servlet/jakarta/servlet/ServletContext.html) init parameters.
1. [`ServletConfig`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/6.1/apidocs/jakarta.servlet/jakarta/servlet/ServletConfig.html) init parameters.
1. Properties from `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON` (inline JSON embedded in an environment variable or system property).
1. Command line arguments.
1. `properties` attribute on your tests.
Available on [`@SpringBootTest`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/test/context/SpringBootTest.html) and the [test annotations for testing a particular slice of your application](../testing/spring-boot-applications.md#testing.spring-boot-applications.autoconfigured-tests).
1. [`@DynamicPropertySource`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/context/DynamicPropertySource.html) annotations in your tests.
1. [`@TestPropertySource`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/context/TestPropertySource.html) annotations on your tests.
1. [Devtools global settings properties](../using/devtools.md#using.devtools.globalsettings) in the `$HOME/.config/spring-boot` directory when devtools is active.

Config data files are considered in the following order:

1. [Application properties](#features.external-config.files) packaged inside your jar (`application.properties` and YAML variants).
1. [Profile-specific application properties](#features.external-config.files.profile-specific) packaged inside your jar (`application-{profile}.properties` and YAML variants).
1. [Application properties](#features.external-config.files) outside of your packaged jar (`application.properties` and YAML variants).
1. [Profile-specific application properties](#features.external-config.files.profile-specific) outside of your packaged jar (`application-{profile}.properties` and YAML variants).

> [!NOTE]
> It is recommended to stick with one format for your entire application.
> If you have configuration files with both `.properties` and YAML format in the same location, `.properties` takes precedence.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use environment variables rather than system properties, most operating systems disallow period-separated key names, but you can use underscores instead (for example, `SPRING_CONFIG_NAME` instead of `spring.config.name`).
> See [Binding From Environment Variables](#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding.environment-variables) for details.

> [!NOTE]
> If your application runs in a servlet container or application server, then JNDI properties (in `java:comp/env`) or servlet context initialization parameters can be used instead of, or as well as, environment variables or system properties.

To provide a concrete example, suppose you develop a [`@Component`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Component.html) that uses a `name` property, as shown in the following example:

#### Java

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class MyBean {

	@Value("${name}")
	private String name;

	// ...

}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component

@Component
class MyBean {

	@Value("\${name}")
	private val name: String? = null

	// ...

}

```

On your application classpath (for example, inside your jar) you can have an `application.properties` file that provides a sensible default property value for `name`.
When running in a new environment, an `application.properties` file can be provided outside of your jar that overrides the `name`.
For one-off testing, you can launch with a specific command line switch (for example, `java -jar app.jar --name="Spring"`).

> [!TIP]
> The `env` and `configprops` endpoints can be useful in determining why a property has a particular value.
> You can use these two endpoints to diagnose unexpected property values.
> See the [Production ready features](../actuator/endpoints.md) section for details.

<a id="features.external-config.command-line-args"></a>

## Accessing Command Line Properties

By default, [`SpringApplication`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/SpringApplication.html) converts any command line option arguments (that is, arguments starting with `--`, such as `--server.port=9000`) to a `property` and adds them to the Spring [`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html).
As mentioned previously, command line properties always take precedence over file-based property sources.

If you do not want command line properties to be added to the [`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html), you can disable them by using `SpringApplication.setAddCommandLineProperties(false)`.

<a id="features.external-config.application-json"></a>

## JSON Application Properties

Environment variables and system properties often have restrictions that mean some property names cannot be used.
To help with this, Spring Boot allows you to encode a block of properties into a single JSON structure.

When your application starts, any `spring.application.json` or `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON` properties will be parsed and added to the [`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html).

For example, the `SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON` property can be supplied on the command line in a UN\*X shell as an environment variable:

```shell
$ SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON='{"my":{"name":"test"}}' java -jar myapp.jar
```

In the preceding example, you end up with `my.name=test` in the Spring [`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html).

The same JSON can also be provided as a system property:

```shell
$ java -Dspring.application.json='{"my":{"name":"test"}}' -jar myapp.jar
```

Or you could supply the JSON by using a command line argument:

```shell
$ java -jar myapp.jar --spring.application.json='{"my":{"name":"test"}}'
```

If you are deploying to a classic Application Server, you could also use a JNDI variable named `java:comp/env/spring.application.json`.

> [!NOTE]
> Although `null` values from the JSON will be added to the resulting property source, the [`PropertySourcesPropertyResolver`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/PropertySourcesPropertyResolver.html) treats `null` properties as missing values.
> This means that the JSON cannot override properties from lower order property sources with a `null` value.

<a id="features.external-config.files"></a>

## External Application Properties

Spring Boot will automatically find and load `application.properties` and `application.yaml` files from the following locations when your application starts:

1. From the classpath

   1. The classpath root
   1. The classpath `/config` package
1. From the current directory

   1. The current directory
   1. The `config/` subdirectory in the current directory
   1. Immediate child directories of the `config/` subdirectory

The list is ordered by precedence (with values from lower items overriding earlier ones).
Documents from the loaded files are added as [`PropertySource`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/PropertySource.html) instances to the Spring [`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html).

If you do not like `application` as the configuration file name, you can switch to another file name by specifying a `spring.config.name` environment property.
For example, to look for `myproject.properties` and `myproject.yaml` files you can run your application as follows:

```shell
$ java -jar myproject.jar --spring.config.name=myproject
```

You can also refer to an explicit location by using the `spring.config.location` environment property.
This property accepts a comma-separated list of one or more locations to check.

The following example shows how to specify two distinct files:

```shell
$ java -jar myproject.jar --spring.config.location=\
	optional:classpath:/default.properties,\
	optional:classpath:/override.properties
```

> [!TIP]
> Use the prefix `optional:` if the [locations are optional](#features.external-config.files.optional-prefix) and you do not mind if they do not exist.

> [!WARNING]
> `spring.config.name`, `spring.config.location`, and `spring.config.additional-location` are used very early to determine which files have to be loaded.
> They must be defined as an environment property (typically an OS environment variable, a system property, or a command-line argument).

If `spring.config.location` contains directories (as opposed to files), they should end in `/`.
At runtime they will be appended with the names generated from `spring.config.name` before being loaded.
Files specified in `spring.config.location` are imported directly.

> [!NOTE]
> Both directory and file location values are also expanded to check for [profile-specific files](#features.external-config.files.profile-specific).
> For example, if you have a `spring.config.location` of `classpath:myconfig.properties`, you will also find appropriate `classpath:myconfig-<profile>.properties` files are loaded.

In most situations, each `spring.config.location` item you add will reference a single file or directory.
Locations are processed in the order that they are defined and later ones can override the values of earlier ones.

<a id="features.external-config.files.location-groups"></a>

If you have a complex location setup, and you use profile-specific configuration files, you may need to provide further hints so that Spring Boot knows how they should be grouped.
A location group is a collection of locations that are all considered at the same level.
For example, you might want to group all classpath locations, then all external locations.
Items within a location group should be separated with `;`.
See the example in the [Profile Specific Files](#features.external-config.files.profile-specific) section for more details.

Locations configured by using `spring.config.location` replace the default locations.
For example, if `spring.config.location` is configured with the value `optional:classpath:/custom-config/,optional:file:./custom-config/`, the complete set of locations considered is:

1. `optional:classpath:custom-config/`
1. `optional:file:./custom-config/`

If you prefer to add additional locations, rather than replacing them, you can use `spring.config.additional-location`.
Properties loaded from additional locations can override those in the default locations.
For example, if `spring.config.additional-location` is configured with the value `optional:classpath:/custom-config/,optional:file:./custom-config/`, the complete set of locations considered is:

1. `optional:classpath:/;optional:classpath:/config/`
1. `optional:file:./;optional:file:./config/;optional:file:./config/*/`
1. `optional:classpath:custom-config/`
1. `optional:file:./custom-config/`

This search ordering lets you specify default values in one configuration file and then selectively override those values in another.
You can provide default values for your application in `application.properties` (or whatever other basename you choose with `spring.config.name`) in one of the default locations.
These default values can then be overridden at runtime with a different file located in one of the custom locations.

<a id="features.external-config.files.optional-prefix"></a>

### Optional Locations

By default, when a specified config data location does not exist, Spring Boot will throw a [`ConfigDataLocationNotFoundException`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/config/ConfigDataLocationNotFoundException.html) and your application will not start.

If you want to specify a location, but you do not mind if it does not always exist, you can use the `optional:` prefix.
You can use this prefix with the `spring.config.location` and `spring.config.additional-location` properties, as well as with [`spring.config.import`](#features.external-config.files.importing) declarations.

For example, a `spring.config.import` value of `optional:file:./myconfig.properties` allows your application to start, even if the `myconfig.properties` file is missing.

If you want to ignore all [`ConfigDataLocationNotFoundException`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/config/ConfigDataLocationNotFoundException.html) errors and always continue to start your application, you can use the `spring.config.on-not-found` property.
Set the value to `ignore` using `SpringApplication.setDefaultProperties(…​)` or with a system/environment variable.

<a id="features.external-config.files.wildcard-locations"></a>

### Wildcard Locations

If a config file location includes the `*` character for the last path segment, it is considered a wildcard location.
Wildcards are expanded when the config is loaded so that immediate subdirectories are also checked.
Wildcard locations are particularly useful in an environment such as Kubernetes when there are multiple sources of config properties.

For example, if you have some Redis configuration and some MySQL configuration, you might want to keep those two pieces of configuration separate, while requiring that both those are present in an `application.properties` file.
This might result in two separate `application.properties` files mounted at different locations such as `/config/redis/application.properties` and `/config/mysql/application.properties`.
In such a case, having a wildcard location of `config/*/`, will result in both files being processed.

By default, Spring Boot includes `config/*/` in the default search locations.
It means that all subdirectories of the `/config` directory outside of your jar will be searched.

You can use wildcard locations yourself with the `spring.config.location` and `spring.config.additional-location` properties.

> [!NOTE]
> A wildcard location must contain only one `*` and end with `*/` for search locations that are directories or `*/<filename>` for search locations that are files.
> Locations with wildcards are sorted alphabetically based on the absolute path of the file names.

> [!TIP]
> Wildcard locations only work with external directories.
> You cannot use a wildcard in a `classpath:` location.

<a id="features.external-config.files.profile-specific"></a>

### Profile Specific Files

As well as `application` property files, Spring Boot will also attempt to load profile-specific files using the naming convention `application-{profile}`.
For example, if your application activates a profile named `prod` and uses YAML files, then both `application.yaml` and `application-prod.yaml` will be considered.

Profile-specific properties are loaded from the same locations as standard `application.properties`, with profile-specific files always overriding the non-specific ones.
If several profiles are specified, a last-wins strategy applies.
For example, if profiles `prod,live` are specified by the `spring.profiles.active` property, values in `application-prod.properties` can be overridden by those in `application-live.properties`.

> [!NOTE]
> The last-wins strategy applies at the [location group](#features.external-config.files.location-groups) level.
> A `spring.config.location` of `classpath:/cfg/,classpath:/ext/` will not have the same override rules as `classpath:/cfg/;classpath:/ext/`.
>
> For example, continuing our `prod,live` example above, we might have the following files:
>
> ```
> /cfg
>   application-live.properties
> /ext
>   application-live.properties
>   application-prod.properties
> ```
>
> When we have a `spring.config.location` of `classpath:/cfg/,classpath:/ext/` we process all `/cfg` files before all `/ext` files:
>
> 1. `/cfg/application-live.properties`
> 1. `/ext/application-prod.properties`
> 1. `/ext/application-live.properties`
>
> When we have `classpath:/cfg/;classpath:/ext/` instead (with a `;` delimiter) we process `/cfg` and `/ext` at the same level:
>
> 1. `/ext/application-prod.properties`
> 1. `/cfg/application-live.properties`
> 1. `/ext/application-live.properties`

The [`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html) has a set of default profiles (by default, `[default]`) that are used if no active profiles are set.
In other words, if no profiles are explicitly activated, then properties from `application-default` are considered.

> [!NOTE]
> Properties files are only ever loaded once.
> If you have already directly [imported](#features.external-config.files.importing) a profile specific property files then it will not be imported a second time.

<a id="features.external-config.files.importing"></a>

### Importing Additional Data

Application properties may import further config data from other locations using the `spring.config.import` property.
Imports are processed as they are discovered, and are treated as additional documents inserted immediately below the one that declares the import.

For example, you might have the following in your classpath `application.properties` file:

#### Properties

```properties
spring.application.name=myapp
spring.config.import=optional:file:./dev.properties
```

#### YAML

```yaml
spring:
  application:
    name: "myapp"
  config:
    import: "optional:file:./dev.properties"
```

This will trigger the import of a `dev.properties` file in current directory (if such a file exists).
Values from the imported `dev.properties` will take precedence over the file that triggered the import.
In the above example, the `dev.properties` could redefine `spring.application.name` to a different value.

> [!NOTE]
> An import will only be imported once no matter how many times it is declared.

By default, properties files are imported using the ISO-8859-1 charset. To change that, you can use the encoding attribute:

#### Properties

```properties
spring.config.import=classpath:import.properties[encoding=utf-8]
```

#### YAML

```yaml
spring:
  config:
    import: "classpath:import.properties[encoding=utf-8]"
```

The `import.properties` file will now be read in UTF-8 encoding.

<a id="features.external-config.files.importing.fixed-and-relative-paths"></a>

#### Using “Fixed” and “Import Relative” Locations

Imports may be specified as *fixed* or *import relative* locations.
A fixed location always resolves to the same underlying resource, regardless of where the `spring.config.import` property is declared.
An import relative location resolves relative to the file that declares the `spring.config.import` property.

A location starting with a forward slash (`/`) or a URL style prefix (`file:`, `classpath:`, etc.) is considered fixed.
All other locations are considered import relative.

> [!NOTE]
> `optional:` prefixes are not considered when determining if a location is fixed or import relative.

As an example, say we have a `/demo` directory containing our `application.jar` file.
We might add a `/demo/application.properties` file with the following content:

```properties
spring.config.import=optional:core/core.properties
```

This is an import relative location and so will attempt to load the file `/demo/core/core.properties` if it exists.

If `/demo/core/core.properties` has the following content:

```properties
spring.config.import=optional:extra/extra.properties
```

It will attempt to load `/demo/core/extra/extra.properties`.
The `optional:extra/extra.properties` is relative to `/demo/core/core.properties` so the full directory is `/demo/core/` + `extra/extra.properties`.

<a id="features.external-config.files.importing.import-property-order"></a>

#### Property Ordering

The order an import is defined inside a single document within the properties/yaml file does not matter.
For instance, the two examples below produce the same result:

#### Properties

```properties
spring.config.import=my.properties
my.property=value
```

#### YAML

```yaml
spring:
  config:
    import: "my.properties"
my:
  property: "value"
```

#### Properties

```properties
my.property=value
spring.config.import=my.properties
```

#### YAML

```yaml
my:
  property: "value"
spring:
  config:
    import: "my.properties"
```

In both of the above examples, the values from the `my.properties` file will take precedence over the file that triggered its import.

Several locations can be specified under a single `spring.config.import` key.
Locations will be processed in the order that they are defined, with later imports taking precedence.

> [!NOTE]
> When appropriate, [Profile-specific variants](#features.external-config.files.profile-specific) are also considered for import.
> The example above would import both `my.properties` as well as any `my-<profile>.properties` variants.

> [!TIP]
> Spring Boot includes pluggable API that allows various different location addresses to be supported.
> By default you can import Java Properties, YAML and [configuration trees](#features.external-config.files.configtree).
>
> Third-party jars can offer support for additional technologies (there is no requirement for files to be local).
> For example, you can imagine config data being from external stores such as Consul, Apache ZooKeeper or Netflix Archaius.
>
> If you want to support your own locations, see the [`ConfigDataLocationResolver`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/config/ConfigDataLocationResolver.html) and [`ConfigDataLoader`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/config/ConfigDataLoader.html) classes in the `org.springframework.boot.context.config` package.

### Importing Extensionless Files

Some cloud platforms cannot add a file extension to volume mounted files.
To import these extensionless files, you need to give Spring Boot a hint so that it knows how to load them.
You can do this by putting an extension hint in square brackets.

For example, suppose you have a `/etc/config/myconfig` file that you wish to import as yaml.
You can import it from your `application.properties` using the following:

#### Properties

```properties
spring.config.import=file:/etc/config/myconfig[.yaml]
```

#### YAML

```yaml
spring:
  config:
    import: "file:/etc/config/myconfig[.yaml]"
```

This is the shorthand for:

#### Properties

```properties
spring.config.import=file:/etc/config/myconfig[extension=.yaml]
```

#### YAML

```yaml
spring:
  config:
    import: "file:/etc/config/myconfig[extension=.yaml]"
```

<a id="features.external-config.files.attributes"></a>

### File attributes

The `spring.config.import` configuration property supports file attributes, as shown when specifying the [encoding](#features.external-config.files.importing) or the [extension](#features.external-config.files.importing-extensionless).

If you need to specify multiple attributes, you can use this syntax:

#### Properties

```properties
spring.config.import=file:/etc/config/myconfig[extension=.yaml][encoding=utf-8]
```

#### YAML

```yaml
spring:
  config:
    import: "file:/etc/config/myconfig[extension=.yaml][encoding=utf-8]"
```

<a id="features.external-config.files.env-variables"></a>

### Using Environment Variables

When running applications on a cloud platform (such as Kubernetes) you often need to read config values that the platform supplies.
You can either use environment variables for such purpose, or you can use [configuration trees](#features.external-config.files.configtree).

You can even store whole configurations in properties or yaml format in (multiline) environment variables and load them using the `env:` prefix.
Assume there’s an environment variable called `MY_CONFIGURATION` with this content:

```properties
my.name=Service1
my.cluster=Cluster1
```

Using the `env:` prefix it is possible to import all properties from this variable:

#### Properties

```properties
spring.config.import=env:MY_CONFIGURATION
```

#### YAML

```yaml
spring:
  config:
    import: "env:MY_CONFIGURATION"
```

> [!TIP]
> This feature also supports [specifying the extension](#features.external-config.files.importing-extensionless).
> The default extension is `.properties`.

<a id="features.external-config.files.configtree"></a>

### Using Configuration Trees

Storing config values in environment variables has drawbacks, especially if the value is supposed to be kept secret.

As an alternative to environment variables, many cloud platforms now allow you to map configuration into mounted data volumes.
For example, Kubernetes can volume mount both [`ConfigMaps`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#populate-a-volume-with-data-stored-in-a-configmap) and [`Secrets`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#using-secrets-as-files-from-a-pod).

There are two common volume mount patterns that can be used:

1. A single file contains a complete set of properties (usually written as YAML).
1. Multiple files are written to a directory tree, with the filename becoming the ‘key’ and the contents becoming the ‘value’.

For the first case, you can import the YAML or Properties file directly using `spring.config.import` as described [above](#features.external-config.files.importing).
For the second case, you need to use the `configtree:` prefix so that Spring Boot knows it needs to expose all the files as properties.

As an example, let’s imagine that Kubernetes has mounted the following volume:

```
etc/
  config/
    myapp/
      username
      password
```

The contents of the `username` file would be a config value, and the contents of `password` would be a secret.

To import these properties, you can add the following to your `application.properties` or `application.yaml` file:

#### Properties

```properties
spring.config.import=optional:configtree:/etc/config/
```

#### YAML

```yaml
spring:
  config:
    import: "optional:configtree:/etc/config/"
```

You can then access or inject `myapp.username` and `myapp.password` properties from the [`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html) in the usual way.

> [!TIP]
> The names of the folders and files under the config tree form the property name.
> In the above example, to access the properties as `username` and `password`, you can set `spring.config.import` to `optional:configtree:/etc/config/myapp`.

> [!NOTE]
> Filenames with dot notation are also correctly mapped.
> For example, in the above example, a file named `myapp.username` in `/etc/config` would result in a `myapp.username` property in the [`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html).

> [!TIP]
> Configuration tree values can be bound to both string [`String`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html) and `byte[]` types depending on the contents expected.

If you have multiple config trees to import from the same parent folder you can use a wildcard shortcut.
Any `configtree:` location that ends with `/*/` will import all immediate children as config trees.
As with a non-wildcard import, the names of the folders and files under each config tree form the property name.

For example, given the following volume:

```
etc/
  config/
    dbconfig/
      db/
        username
        password
    mqconfig/
      mq/
        username
        password
```

You can use `configtree:/etc/config/*/` as the import location:

#### Properties

```properties
spring.config.import=optional:configtree:/etc/config/*/
```

#### YAML

```yaml
spring:
  config:
    import: "optional:configtree:/etc/config/*/"
```

This will add `db.username`, `db.password`, `mq.username` and `mq.password` properties.

> [!NOTE]
> Directories loaded using a wildcard are sorted alphabetically.
> If you need a different order, then you should list each location as a separate import

Configuration trees can also be used for Docker secrets.
When a Docker swarm service is granted access to a secret, the secret gets mounted into the container.
For example, if a secret named `db.password` is mounted at location `/run/secrets/`, you can make `db.password` available to the Spring environment using the following:

#### Properties

```properties
spring.config.import=optional:configtree:/run/secrets/
```

#### YAML

```yaml
spring:
  config:
    import: "optional:configtree:/run/secrets/"
```

<a id="features.external-config.files.property-placeholders"></a>

### Property Placeholders

The values in `application.properties` and `application.yaml` are filtered through the existing [`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html) when they are used, so you can refer back to previously defined values (for example, from System properties or environment variables).
The standard `${name}` property-placeholder syntax can be used anywhere within a value.
Property placeholders can also specify a default value using a `:` to separate the default value from the property name, for example `${name:default}`.

The use of placeholders with and without defaults is shown in the following example:

#### Properties

```properties
app.name=MyApp
app.description=${app.name} is a Spring Boot application written by ${username:Unknown}
```

#### YAML

```yaml
app:
  name: "MyApp"
  description: "${app.name} is a Spring Boot application written by ${username:Unknown}"
```

Assuming that the `username` property has not been set elsewhere, `app.description` will have the value `MyApp is a Spring Boot application written by Unknown`.

> [!NOTE]
> You should always refer to property names in the placeholder using their canonical form (kebab-case using only lowercase letters).
> This will allow Spring Boot to use the same logic as it does when [relaxed binding](#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding) [`@ConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html).
>
> For example, `${demo.item-price}` will pick up `demo.item-price` and `demo.itemPrice` forms from the `application.properties` file, as well as `DEMO_ITEMPRICE` from the system environment.
> If you use `${demo.itemPrice}` instead, it will pick up the `demo.itemPrice` form from the `application.properties` file, as well as `DEMO_ITEMPRICE` from the system environment, but `demo.item-price` would not be considered.

> [!TIP]
> You can also use this technique to create “short” variants of existing Spring Boot properties.
> See the [how-to:properties-and-configuration.adoc#howto.properties-and-configuration.short-command-line-arguments](../../how-to/properties-and-configuration.md#howto.properties-and-configuration.short-command-line-arguments) section in “How-to Guides” for details.

<a id="features.external-config.files.multi-document"></a>

### Working With Multi-Document Files

Spring Boot allows you to split a single physical file into multiple logical documents which are each added independently.
Documents are processed in order, from top to bottom.
Later documents can override the properties defined in earlier ones.

For `application.yaml` files, the standard YAML multi-document syntax is used.
Three consecutive hyphens represent the end of one document, and the start of the next.

For example, the following file has two logical documents:

```yaml
spring:
  application:
    name: "MyApp"
---
spring:
  application:
    name: "MyCloudApp"
  config:
    activate:
      on-cloud-platform: "kubernetes"
```

For `application.properties` files a special `#---` or `!---` comment is used to mark the document splits:

```properties
spring.application.name=MyApp
#---
spring.application.name=MyCloudApp
spring.config.activate.on-cloud-platform=kubernetes
```

> [!NOTE]
> Property file separators must not have any leading whitespace and must have exactly three hyphen characters.
> The lines immediately before and after the separator must not be same comment prefix.

> [!TIP]
> Multi-document property files are often used in conjunction with activation properties such as `spring.config.activate.on-profile`.
> See the [next section](#features.external-config.files.activation-properties) for details.

> [!WARNING]
> Multi-document property files cannot be loaded by using the [`@PropertySource`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/PropertySource.html) or [`@TestPropertySource`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/context/TestPropertySource.html) annotations.

<a id="features.external-config.files.activation-properties"></a>

### Activation Properties

It is sometimes useful to only activate a given set of properties when certain conditions are met.
For example, you might have properties that are only relevant when a specific profile is active.

You can conditionally activate a properties document using `spring.config.activate.*`.

The following activation properties are available:

| Property | Note |
| --- | --- |
| `on-profile` | A profile expression that must match for the document to be active, or a list of profile expressions of which at least one must match for the document to be active. |
| `on-cloud-platform` | The [`CloudPlatform`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/cloud/CloudPlatform.html) that must be detected for the document to be active. |

For example, the following specifies that the second document is only active when running on Kubernetes, and only when either the “prod” or “staging” profiles are active:

#### Properties

```properties
myprop=always-set
#---
spring.config.activate.on-cloud-platform=kubernetes
spring.config.activate.on-profile=prod | staging
myotherprop=sometimes-set
```

#### YAML

```yaml
myprop:
  "always-set"
---
spring:
  config:
    activate:
      on-cloud-platform: "kubernetes"
      on-profile: "prod | staging"
myotherprop: "sometimes-set"
```

<a id="features.external-config.encrypting"></a>

## Encrypting Properties

Spring Boot does not provide any built-in support for encrypting property values, however, it does provide the hook points necessary to modify values contained in the Spring [`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html).
The [`EnvironmentPostProcessor`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/EnvironmentPostProcessor.html) interface allows you to manipulate the [`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html) before the application starts.
See [how-to:application.adoc#howto.application.customize-the-environment-or-application-context](../../how-to/application.md#howto.application.customize-the-environment-or-application-context) for details.

If you need a secure way to store credentials and passwords, the [Spring Cloud Vault](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-vault/) project provides support for storing externalized configuration in [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/).

<a id="features.external-config.yaml"></a>

## Working With YAML

[YAML](https://yaml.org) is a superset of JSON and, as such, is a convenient format for specifying hierarchical configuration data.
The [`SpringApplication`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/SpringApplication.html) class automatically supports YAML as an alternative to properties whenever you have the [SnakeYAML](https://github.com/snakeyaml/snakeyaml) library on your classpath.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use starters, SnakeYAML is automatically provided by `spring-boot-starter`.

<a id="features.external-config.yaml.mapping-to-properties"></a>

### Mapping YAML to Properties

YAML documents need to be converted from their hierarchical format to a flat structure that can be used with the Spring [`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html).
For example, consider the following YAML document:

```yaml
environments:
  dev:
    url: "https://dev.example.com"
    name: "Developer Setup"
  prod:
    url: "https://another.example.com"
    name: "My Cool App"
```

In order to access these properties from the [`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html), they would be flattened as follows:

```properties
environments.dev.url=https://dev.example.com
environments.dev.name=Developer Setup
environments.prod.url=https://another.example.com
environments.prod.name=My Cool App
```

Likewise, YAML lists also need to be flattened.
They are represented as property keys with `[index]` dereferencers.
For example, consider the following YAML:

```yaml
 my:
  servers:
  - "dev.example.com"
  - "another.example.com"
```

The preceding example would be transformed into these properties:

```properties
my.servers[0]=dev.example.com
my.servers[1]=another.example.com
```

> [!TIP]
> Properties that use the `[index]` notation can be bound to Java [`List`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html) or [`Set`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Set.html) objects using Spring Boot’s [`Binder`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/bind/Binder.html) class.
> For more details see the [Type-safe Configuration Properties](#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties) section below.

> [!WARNING]
> YAML files cannot be loaded by using the [`@PropertySource`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/PropertySource.html) or [`@TestPropertySource`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/context/TestPropertySource.html) annotations.
> So, in the case that you need to load values that way, you need to use a properties file.

<a id="features.external-config.yaml.directly-loading"></a>

### Directly Loading YAML

Spring Framework provides two convenient classes that can be used to load YAML documents.
The [`YamlPropertiesFactoryBean`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/YamlPropertiesFactoryBean.html) loads YAML as [`Properties`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Properties.html) and the [`YamlMapFactoryBean`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/YamlMapFactoryBean.html) loads YAML as a [`Map`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html).

You can also use the [`YamlPropertySourceLoader`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/env/YamlPropertySourceLoader.html) class if you want to load YAML as a Spring [`PropertySource`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/PropertySource.html).

<a id="features.external-config.random-values"></a>

## Configuring Random Values

The [`RandomValuePropertySource`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/env/RandomValuePropertySource.html) is useful for injecting random values (for example, into secrets or test cases).
It can produce integers, longs, uuids, or strings, as shown in the following example:

#### Properties

```properties
my.secret=${random.value}
my.number=${random.int}
my.bignumber=${random.long}
my.uuid=${random.uuid}
my.number-less-than-ten=${random.int(10)}
my.number-in-range=${random.int[1024,65536]}
```

#### YAML

```yaml
my:
  secret: "${random.value}"
  number: "${random.int}"
  bignumber: "${random.long}"
  uuid: "${random.uuid}"
  number-less-than-ten: "${random.int(10)}"
  number-in-range: "${random.int[1024,65536]}"
```

The `random.int*` syntax is `OPEN value (,max) CLOSE` where the `OPEN,CLOSE` are any character and `value,max` are integers.
If `max` is provided, then `value` is the minimum value and `max` is the maximum value (exclusive).

<a id="features.external-config.system-environment"></a>

## Configuring System Environment Properties

Spring Boot supports setting a prefix for environment properties.
This is useful if the system environment is shared by multiple Spring Boot applications with different configuration requirements.
The prefix for system environment properties can be set directly on [`SpringApplication`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/SpringApplication.html) by calling the `setEnvironmentPrefix(…​)` method before the application is run.

For example, if you set the prefix to `input`, a property such as `remote.timeout` will be resolved as `INPUT_REMOTE_TIMEOUT` in the system environment.

> [!NOTE]
> The prefix *only* applies to system environment properties.
> The example above would continue to use `remote.timeout` when reading properties from other sources.

<a id="features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties"></a>

## Type-safe Configuration Properties

Using the `@Value("${property}")` annotation to inject configuration properties can sometimes be cumbersome, especially if you are working with multiple properties or your data is hierarchical in nature.
Spring Boot provides an alternative method of working with properties that lets strongly typed beans govern and validate the configuration of your application.

> [!TIP]
> See also the [differences between [`@Value`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Value.html) and type-safe configuration properties](#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.vs-value-annotation).

<a id="features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.java-bean-binding"></a>

### JavaBean Properties Binding

It is possible to bind a bean declaring standard JavaBean properties as shown in the following example:

#### Java

```java
import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;

@ConfigurationProperties("my.service")
public class MyProperties {

	private boolean enabled;

	private InetAddress remoteAddress;

	private final Security security = new Security();
	public boolean isEnabled() {
		return this.enabled;
	}

	public void setEnabled(boolean enabled) {
		this.enabled = enabled;
	}

	public InetAddress getRemoteAddress() {
		return this.remoteAddress;
	}

	public void setRemoteAddress(InetAddress remoteAddress) {
		this.remoteAddress = remoteAddress;
	}

	public Security getSecurity() {
		return this.security;
	}
	public static class Security {

		private String username;

		private String password;

		private List<String> roles = new ArrayList<>(Collections.singleton("USER"));
		public String getUsername() {
			return this.username;
		}

		public void setUsername(String username) {
			this.username = username;
		}

		public String getPassword() {
			return this.password;
		}

		public void setPassword(String password) {
			this.password = password;
		}

		public List<String> getRoles() {
			return this.roles;
		}

		public void setRoles(List<String> roles) {
			this.roles = roles;
		}
	}

}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties
import java.net.InetAddress

@ConfigurationProperties("my.service")
class MyProperties {

	var isEnabled = false

	var remoteAddress: InetAddress? = null

	val security = Security()

	class Security {

		var username: String? = null

		var password: String? = null

		var roles: List<String> = ArrayList(setOf("USER"))

	}

}

```

The preceding POJO defines the following properties:

- `my.service.enabled`, with a value of `false` by default.
- `my.service.remote-address`, with a type that can be coerced from [`String`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html).
- `my.service.security.username`, with a nested "security" object whose name is determined by the name of the property.
In particular, the type is not used at all there and could have been [`SecurityProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/security/autoconfigure/SecurityProperties.html).
- `my.service.security.password`.
- `my.service.security.roles`, with a collection of [`String`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html) that defaults to `USER`.

> [!TIP]
> To use a reserved keyword in the name of a property, such as `my.service.import`, use the [`@Name`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/bind/Name.html) annotation on the property’s field.

> [!NOTE]
> The properties that map to [`@ConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html) classes available in Spring Boot, which are configured through properties files, YAML files, environment variables, and other mechanisms, are public API but the accessors (getters/setters) of the class itself are not meant to be used directly.

> [!NOTE]
> Such arrangement relies on a default empty constructor and getters and setters are usually mandatory, since binding is through standard Java Beans property descriptors, just like in Spring MVC.
> A setter may be omitted in the following cases:
>
> - Pre-initialized Maps and Collections, as long as they are initialized with a mutable implementation (like the `roles` field in the preceding example).
> - Pre-initialized nested POJOs (like the `Security` field in the preceding example).
> If you want the binder to create the instance on the fly by using its default constructor, you need a setter.
>
> Some people use Project Lombok to add getters and setters automatically.
> Make sure that Lombok does not generate any particular constructor for such a type, as it is used automatically by the container to instantiate the object.
>
> Finally, only standard Java Bean properties are considered and binding on static properties is not supported.

<a id="features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.constructor-binding"></a>

### Constructor Binding

The example in the previous section can be rewritten in an immutable fashion as shown in the following example:

#### Java

```java
import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.util.List;

import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.bind.DefaultValue;

@ConfigurationProperties("my.service")
public class MyProperties {
	private final boolean enabled;

	private final InetAddress remoteAddress;

	private final Security security;
	public MyProperties(boolean enabled, InetAddress remoteAddress, Security security) {
		this.enabled = enabled;
		this.remoteAddress = remoteAddress;
		this.security = security;
	}
	public boolean isEnabled() {
		return this.enabled;
	}

	public InetAddress getRemoteAddress() {
		return this.remoteAddress;
	}

	public Security getSecurity() {
		return this.security;
	}
	public static class Security {
		private final String username;

		private final String password;

		private final List<String> roles;
		public Security(String username, String password, @DefaultValue("USER") List<String> roles) {
			this.username = username;
			this.password = password;
			this.roles = roles;
		}
		public String getUsername() {
			return this.username;
		}

		public String getPassword() {
			return this.password;
		}

		public List<String> getRoles() {
			return this.roles;
		}
	}

}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.bind.DefaultValue
import java.net.InetAddress

@ConfigurationProperties("my.service")
class MyProperties(val enabled: Boolean, val remoteAddress: InetAddress,
		val security: Security) {

	class Security(val username: String, val password: String,
			@param:DefaultValue("USER") val roles: List<String>)

}

```

In this setup, the presence of a single parameterized constructor implies that constructor binding should be used.
This means that the binder will find a constructor with the parameters that you wish to have bound.
If your class has multiple constructors, the [`@ConstructorBinding`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/bind/ConstructorBinding.html) annotation can be used to specify which constructor to use for constructor binding.

To opt-out of constructor binding for a class, the parameterized constructor must be annotated with [`@Autowired`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Autowired.html) or made `private`.
Kotlin developers can use an empty primary constructor to opt-out of constructor binding.

For example:

#### Java

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;

@ConfigurationProperties("my")
public class MyProperties {
	final MyBean myBean;

	private String name;
	@Autowired
	public MyProperties(MyBean myBean) {
		this.myBean = myBean;
	}
	public String getName() {
		return this.name;
	}

	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties

@ConfigurationProperties("my")
class MyProperties() {

	constructor(name: String) : this() {
		this.name = name
	}
	var name: String? = null
}

```

Constructor binding can be used with records.
Unless your record has multiple constructors, there is no need to use [`@ConstructorBinding`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/bind/ConstructorBinding.html).

Nested members of a constructor bound class (such as `Security` in the example above) will also be bound through their constructor.

> [!NOTE]
> To use constructor binding the class must be enabled using [`@EnableConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/EnableConfigurationProperties.html) or configuration property scanning.
> You cannot use constructor binding with beans that are created by the regular Spring mechanisms (for example [`@Component`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Component.html) beans, beans created by using [`@Bean`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Bean.html) methods or beans loaded by using [`@Import`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Import.html))

> [!NOTE]
> To use constructor binding the class must be compiled with `-parameters`.
> This will happen automatically if you use Spring Boot’s Gradle plugin or if you use Maven and `spring-boot-starter-parent`.

> [!NOTE]
> The use of [`Optional`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Optional.html) with [`@ConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html) is not recommended as it is primarily intended for use as a return type.
> As such, it is not well-suited to configuration property injection.
> If you do declare an [`Optional`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Optional.html) constructor-bound property and it has no value, an empty [`Optional`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Optional.html) will be bound.

> [!TIP]
> To use a reserved keyword in the name of a property, such as `my.service.import`, use the [`@Name`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/bind/Name.html) annotation on the constructor parameter.

<a id="features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.constructor-binding.default-values"></a>

#### @DefaultValue and Binding

Default values can be specified using [`@DefaultValue`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/bind/DefaultValue.html) on constructor parameters and record components.
The conversion service will be applied to coerce the annotation’s [`String`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html) value to the target type of a missing property.

In the `MyProperties` example above, you can see the nested `Security` class uses `@DefaultValue("USER")` for the `roles` parameter.
This means that if `security` properties are defined, but `roles` is not, the default of `"USER"` will be bound.

For example, the following properties:

#### Properties

```properties
my.service.enabled=true
my.service.security.username=admin
```

#### YAML

```yaml
my:
  service:
    enabled: true
    security:
      username: admin
```

Will be bound as `new MyProperties(true, null, new Security("admin", null, List.of("USER")))`

If the `security` property is not present at all, then the `Security` instance will be `null`.

For example, the following properties:

#### Properties

```properties
my.service.enabled=true
```

#### YAML

```yaml
my:
  service:
    enabled: true
```

Will be bound as `new MyProperties(true, null, null)`

> [!NOTE]
> You can define an empty `security` property if you want to trigger binding with fully default `Security` instance.
>
> For YAML, you can use the following syntax:
>
> ```yaml
> my:
>   service:
>     enabled: true
>     security: {}
> ```
>
> With `Properties` you can use:
>
> ```properties
> my.service.enabled=true
> my.service.security=
> ```
>
> Will be bound as `new MyProperties(true, null, new Security(null, null, List.of("USER")))`

If you want to always bind a non-null instance of `Security`, even when properties are missing, you can use an empty [`@DefaultValue`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/bind/DefaultValue.html) annotation:

#### Java

```java
	public MyProperties(boolean enabled, InetAddress remoteAddress, @DefaultValue Security security) {
		this.enabled = enabled;
		this.remoteAddress = remoteAddress;
		this.security = security;
	}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
class MyProperties(val enabled: Boolean, val remoteAddress: InetAddress,
		@DefaultValue val security: Security) {

	class Security(val username: String?, val password: String?,
			@param:DefaultValue("USER") val roles: List<String>)

}
```

> [!TIP]
> When using Kotlin, you will need to declare the `username` and `password` parameters as nullable since they do not have default values

<a id="features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.default-values"></a>

### Default Values

Default Values defined in configuration properties are not reflected in the [`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html).
In the examples above, the `enabled` property of `MyProperties` bound to `my.service` is `false` by default.

However,  `my.service.enabled` is not available in the `Environment` with a value of `false` if no such property is set by the user.
Concretely, this prevents you from using `@Value("${my.service.enabled}")` or `my.service.enabled` as a placeholder in configuration properties without explicitly providing a default.
If you need to query the [`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html) for that property, for instance in a [`Condition`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Condition.html) implementation, the default needs to be provided as well.

<a id="features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.enabling-annotated-types"></a>

### Enabling @ConfigurationProperties-annotated Types

Spring Boot provides infrastructure to bind [`@ConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html) types and register them as beans.
You can either enable configuration properties on a class-by-class basis or enable configuration property scanning that works in a similar manner to component scanning.

Sometimes, classes annotated with [`@ConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html) might not be suitable for scanning, for example, if you’re developing your own auto-configuration or you want to enable them conditionally.
In these cases, specify the list of types to process using the [`@EnableConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/EnableConfigurationProperties.html) annotation.
This can be done on any [`@Configuration`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Configuration.html) class, as shown in the following example:

#### Java

```java
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.EnableConfigurationProperties;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
@EnableConfigurationProperties(SomeProperties.class)
public class MyConfiguration {

}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.EnableConfigurationProperties
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration

@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
@EnableConfigurationProperties(SomeProperties::class)
class MyConfiguration

```

#### Java

```java
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;

@ConfigurationProperties("some.properties")
public class SomeProperties {

}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties

@ConfigurationProperties("some.properties")
class SomeProperties

```

To use configuration property scanning, add the [`@ConfigurationPropertiesScan`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationPropertiesScan.html) annotation to your application.
Typically, it is added to the main application class that is annotated with [`@SpringBootApplication`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/SpringBootApplication.html) but it can be added to any [`@Configuration`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Configuration.html) class.
By default, scanning will occur from the package of the class that declares the annotation.
If you want to define specific packages to scan, you can do so as shown in the following example:

#### Java

```java
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationPropertiesScan;

@SpringBootApplication
@ConfigurationPropertiesScan({ "com.example.app", "com.example.another" })
public class MyApplication {

}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationPropertiesScan

@SpringBootApplication
@ConfigurationPropertiesScan("com.example.app", "com.example.another")
class MyApplication

```

> [!NOTE]
> When the [`@ConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html) bean is registered using configuration property scanning or through [`@EnableConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/EnableConfigurationProperties.html), the bean has a conventional name: `<prefix>-<fqn>`, where `<prefix>` is the environment key prefix specified in the [`@ConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html) annotation and `<fqn>` is the fully qualified name of the bean.
> If the annotation does not provide any prefix, only the fully qualified name of the bean is used.
>
> Assuming that it is in the `com.example.app` package, the bean name of the `SomeProperties` example above is `some.properties-com.example.app.SomeProperties`.

We recommend that [`@ConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html) only deal with the environment and, in particular, does not inject other beans from the context.
For corner cases, setter injection can be used or any of the `*Aware` interfaces provided by the framework (such as [`EnvironmentAware`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/EnvironmentAware.html) if you need access to the [`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html)).
If you still want to inject other beans using the constructor, the configuration properties bean must be annotated with [`@Component`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Component.html) and use JavaBean-based property binding.

<a id="features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.using-annotated-types"></a>

### Using @ConfigurationProperties-annotated Types

This style of configuration works particularly well with the [`SpringApplication`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/SpringApplication.html) external YAML configuration, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
my:
  service:
    remote-address: 192.168.1.1
    security:
      username: "admin"
      roles:
      - "USER"
      - "ADMIN"
```

To work with [`@ConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html) beans, you can inject them in the same way as any other bean, as shown in the following example:

#### Java

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MyService {

	private final MyProperties properties;

	public MyService(MyProperties properties) {
		this.properties = properties;
	}

	public void openConnection() {
		Server server = new Server(this.properties.getRemoteAddress());
		server.start();
		// ...
	}

	// ...

}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service

@Service
class MyService(val properties: MyProperties) {

	fun openConnection() {
		val server = Server(properties.remoteAddress)
		server.start()
		// ...
	}

	// ...

}

```

> [!TIP]
> Using [`@ConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html) also lets you generate metadata files that can be used by IDEs to offer auto-completion for your own keys.
> See the [appendix](../../specification/configuration-metadata/index.md) for details.

<a id="features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.third-party-configuration"></a>

### Third-party Configuration

As well as using [`@ConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html) to annotate a class, you can also use it on public [`@Bean`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Bean.html) methods.
Doing so can be particularly useful when you want to bind properties to third-party components that are outside of your control.

To configure a bean from the [`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html) properties, add [`@ConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html) to its bean registration, as shown in the following example:

#### Java

```java
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
public class ThirdPartyConfiguration {

	@Bean
	@ConfigurationProperties("another")
	public AnotherComponent anotherComponent() {
		return new AnotherComponent();
	}

}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration

@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
class ThirdPartyConfiguration {

	@Bean
	@ConfigurationProperties("another")
	fun anotherComponent(): AnotherComponent = AnotherComponent()

}

```

Any JavaBean property defined with the `another` prefix is mapped onto that `AnotherComponent` bean in manner similar to the preceding `SomeProperties` example.

<a id="features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding"></a>

### Relaxed Binding

Spring Boot uses some relaxed rules for binding [`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html) properties to [`@ConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html) beans, so there does not need to be an exact match between the [`Environment`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html) property name and the bean property name.
Common examples where this is useful include dash-separated environment properties (for example, `context-path` binds to `contextPath`), and capitalized environment properties (for example, `PORT` binds to `port`).

As an example, consider the following [`@ConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html) class:

#### Java

```java
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;

@ConfigurationProperties("my.main-project.person")
public class MyPersonProperties {

	private String firstName;

	public String getFirstName() {
		return this.firstName;
	}

	public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
		this.firstName = firstName;
	}

}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties

@ConfigurationProperties("my.main-project.person")
class MyPersonProperties {

	var firstName: String? = null

}

```

With the preceding code, the following properties names can all be used:

| Property | Note |
| --- | --- |
| `my.main-project.person.first-name` | Kebab case, which is recommended for use in `.properties` and YAML files. |
| `my.main-project.person.firstName` | Standard camel case syntax. |
| `my.main-project.person.first_name` | Underscore notation, which is an alternative format for use in `.properties` and YAML files. |
| `MY_MAINPROJECT_PERSON_FIRSTNAME` | Upper case format, which is recommended when using system environment variables. |

> [!NOTE]
> The `prefix` value for the annotation *must* be in kebab case (lowercase and separated by `-`, such as `my.main-project.person`).

| Property Source | Simple | List |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Properties Files | Camel case, kebab case, or underscore notation | Standard list syntax using `[ ]` or comma-separated values |
| YAML Files | Camel case, kebab case, or underscore notation | Standard YAML list syntax or comma-separated values |
| Environment Variables | Upper case format with underscore as the delimiter (see [Binding From Environment Variables](#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding.environment-variables)). | Numeric values surrounded by underscores (see [Binding From Environment Variables](#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding.environment-variables)) |
| System properties | Camel case, kebab case, or underscore notation | Standard list syntax using `[ ]` or comma-separated values |

> [!TIP]
> We recommend that, when possible, properties are stored in lower-case kebab format, such as `my.person.first-name=Rod`.

<a id="features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding.maps"></a>

#### Binding Maps

When binding to [`Map`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html) properties you may need to use a special bracket notation so that the original `key` value is preserved.
If the key is not surrounded by `[]`, any characters that are not alpha-numeric, `-` or `.` are removed.

For example, consider binding the following properties to a `Map<String,String>`:

#### Properties

```properties
my.map[/key1]=value1
my.map[/key2]=value2
my.map./key3=value3
```

#### YAML

```yaml
my:
  map:
    "[/key1]": "value1"
    "[/key2]": "value2"
    "/key3": "value3"
```

> [!NOTE]
> For YAML files, the brackets need to be surrounded by quotes for the keys to be parsed properly.

The properties above will bind to a [`Map`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html) with `/key1`, `/key2` and `key3` as the keys in the map.
The slash has been removed from `key3` because it was not surrounded by square brackets.

When binding to scalar values, keys with `.` in them do not need to be surrounded by `[]`.
Scalar values include enums and all types in the `java.lang` package except for [`Object`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Object.html).
Binding `a.b=c` to `Map<String, String>` will preserve the `.` in the key and return a Map with the entry `{"a.b"="c"}`.
For any other types you need to use the bracket notation if your `key` contains a `.`.
For example, binding `a.b=c` to `Map<String, Object>` will return a Map with the entry `{"a"={"b"="c"}}` whereas `[a.b]=c` will return a Map with the entry `{"a.b"="c"}`.

<a id="features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding.environment-variables"></a>

#### Binding From Environment Variables

Most operating systems impose strict rules around the names that can be used for environment variables.
For example, Linux shell variables can contain only letters (`a` to `z` or `A` to `Z`), numbers (`0` to `9`) or the underscore character (`_`).
By convention, Unix shell variables will also have their names in UPPERCASE.

Spring Boot’s relaxed binding rules are, as much as possible, designed to be compatible with these naming restrictions.

To convert a property name in the canonical-form to an environment variable name you can follow these rules:

- Replace dots (`.`) with underscores (`_`).
- Remove any dashes (`-`).
- Convert to uppercase.

For example, the configuration property `spring.main.log-startup-info` would be an environment variable named `SPRING_MAIN_LOGSTARTUPINFO`.

Environment variables can also be used when binding to object lists.
To bind to a [`List`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html), the element number should be surrounded with underscores in the variable name.

For example, the configuration property `my.service[0].other` would use an environment variable named `MY_SERVICE_0_OTHER`.

Support for binding from environment variables is applied to the `systemEnvironment` property source and to any additional property source whose name ends with `-systemEnvironment`.

<a id="features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding.maps-from-environment-variables"></a>

#### Binding Maps From Environment Variables

When Spring Boot binds an environment variable to a property class, it lowercases the environment variable name before binding.
Most of the time this detail isn’t important, except when binding to [`Map`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html) properties.

The keys in the [`Map`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html) are always in lowercase, as seen in the following example:

#### Java

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;

@ConfigurationProperties("my.props")
public class MyMapsProperties {

	private final Map<String, String> values = new HashMap<>();

	public Map<String, String> getValues() {
		return this.values;
	}

}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties

@ConfigurationProperties("my.props")
class MyMapsProperties {

	val values: Map<String, String> = HashMap()

}

```

When setting `MY_PROPS_VALUES_KEY=value`, the `values` [`Map`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html) contains a `{"key"="value"}` entry.

Only the environment variable **name** is lower-cased, not the value.
When setting `MY_PROPS_VALUES_KEY=VALUE`, the `values` [`Map`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html) contains a `{"key"="VALUE"}` entry.

<a id="features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding.caching"></a>

#### Caching

Relaxed binding uses a cache to improve performance. By default, this caching is only applied to immutable property sources.
To customize this behavior, for example to enable caching for mutable property sources, use [`ConfigurationPropertyCaching`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/source/ConfigurationPropertyCaching.html).

<a id="features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.merging-complex-types"></a>

### Merging Complex Types

When lists are configured in more than one place, overriding works by replacing the entire list.

For example, assume a `MyPojo` object with `name` and `description` attributes that are `null` by default.
The following example exposes a list of `MyPojo` objects from `MyProperties`:

#### Java

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;

@ConfigurationProperties("my")
public class MyProperties {

	private final List<MyPojo> list = new ArrayList<>();

	public List<MyPojo> getList() {
		return this.list;
	}

}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties

@ConfigurationProperties("my")
class MyProperties {

	val list: List<MyPojo> = ArrayList()

}

```

Consider the following configuration:

#### Properties

```properties
my.list[0].name=my name
my.list[0].description=my description
#---
spring.config.activate.on-profile=dev
my.list[0].name=my another name
```

#### YAML

```yaml
my:
  list:
  - name: "my name"
    description: "my description"
---
spring:
  config:
    activate:
      on-profile: "dev"
my:
  list:
  - name: "my another name"
```

If the `dev` profile is not active, `MyProperties.list` contains one `MyPojo` entry, as previously defined.
If the `dev` profile is enabled, however, the `list` *still* contains only one entry (with a name of `my another name` and a description of `null`).
This configuration *does not* add a second `MyPojo` instance to the list, and it does not merge the items.

When a [`List`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html) is specified in multiple profiles, the one with the highest priority (and only that one) is used.
Consider the following example:

#### Properties

```properties
my.list[0].name=my name
my.list[0].description=my description
my.list[1].name=another name
my.list[1].description=another description
#---
spring.config.activate.on-profile=dev
my.list[0].name=my another name
```

#### YAML

```yaml
my:
  list:
  - name: "my name"
    description: "my description"
  - name: "another name"
    description: "another description"
---
spring:
  config:
    activate:
      on-profile: "dev"
my:
  list:
  - name: "my another name"
```

In the preceding example, if the `dev` profile is active, `MyProperties.list` contains *one* `MyPojo` entry (with a name of `my another name` and a description of `null`).
For YAML, both comma-separated lists and YAML lists can be used for completely overriding the contents of the list.

For [`Map`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html) properties, you can bind with property values drawn from multiple sources.
However, for the same property in multiple sources, the one with the highest priority is used.
The following example exposes a `Map<String, MyPojo>` from `MyProperties`:

#### Java

```java
import java.util.LinkedHashMap;
import java.util.Map;

import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;

@ConfigurationProperties("my")
public class MyProperties {

	private final Map<String, MyPojo> map = new LinkedHashMap<>();

	public Map<String, MyPojo> getMap() {
		return this.map;
	}

}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties

@ConfigurationProperties("my")
class MyProperties {

	val map: Map<String, MyPojo> = LinkedHashMap()

}

```

Consider the following configuration:

#### Properties

```properties
my.map.key1.name=my name 1
my.map.key1.description=my description 1
#---
spring.config.activate.on-profile=dev
my.map.key1.name=dev name 1
my.map.key2.name=dev name 2
my.map.key2.description=dev description 2
```

#### YAML

```yaml
my:
  map:
    key1:
      name: "my name 1"
      description: "my description 1"
---
spring:
  config:
    activate:
      on-profile: "dev"
my:
  map:
    key1:
      name: "dev name 1"
    key2:
      name: "dev name 2"
      description: "dev description 2"
```

If the `dev` profile is not active, `MyProperties.map` contains one entry with key `key1` (with a name of `my name 1` and a description of `my description 1`).
If the `dev` profile is enabled, however, `map` contains two entries with keys `key1` (with a name of `dev name 1` and a description of `my description 1`) and `key2` (with a name of `dev name 2` and a description of `dev description 2`).

> [!NOTE]
> The preceding merging rules apply to properties from all property sources, and not just files.

<a id="features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.conversion"></a>

### Properties Conversion

Spring Boot attempts to coerce the external application properties to the right type when it binds to the [`@ConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html) beans.
If you need custom type conversion, you can provide a [`ConversionService`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/convert/ConversionService.html) bean (with a bean named `conversionService`) or custom property editors (through a [`CustomEditorConfigurer`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/CustomEditorConfigurer.html) bean) or custom converters (with bean definitions annotated as [`@ConfigurationPropertiesBinding`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationPropertiesBinding.html)).

> [!NOTE]
> Beans used for property conversion are requested very early during the application lifecycle so make sure to limit the dependencies that your [`ConversionService`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/convert/ConversionService.html) is using.
> Typically, any dependency that you require may not be fully initialized at creation time.

> [!TIP]
> You may want to rename your custom [`ConversionService`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/convert/ConversionService.html) if it is not required for configuration keys coercion and only rely on custom converters qualified with [`@ConfigurationPropertiesBinding`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationPropertiesBinding.html).
> When qualifying a `@Bean` method with `@ConfigurationPropertiesBinding`, the method should be `static` to avoid “bean is not eligible for getting processed by all BeanPostProcessors” warnings.

<a id="features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.conversion.durations"></a>

#### Converting Durations

Spring Boot has dedicated support for expressing durations.
If you expose a [`Duration`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Duration.html) property, the following formats in application properties are available:

- A regular `long` representation (using milliseconds as the default unit unless a [`@DurationUnit`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/convert/DurationUnit.html) has been specified)
- The standard ISO-8601 format [used by [`Duration`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Duration.html)](<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Duration.html#parse(java.lang.CharSequence)>)
- A more readable format where the value and the unit are coupled (`10s` means 10 seconds)

Consider the following example:

#### Java

```java
import java.time.Duration;
import java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit;

import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;
import org.springframework.boot.convert.DurationUnit;

@ConfigurationProperties("my")
public class MyProperties {

	@DurationUnit(ChronoUnit.SECONDS)
	private Duration sessionTimeout = Duration.ofSeconds(30);

	private Duration readTimeout = Duration.ofMillis(1000);
	public Duration getSessionTimeout() {
		return this.sessionTimeout;
	}

	public void setSessionTimeout(Duration sessionTimeout) {
		this.sessionTimeout = sessionTimeout;
	}

	public Duration getReadTimeout() {
		return this.readTimeout;
	}

	public void setReadTimeout(Duration readTimeout) {
		this.readTimeout = readTimeout;
	}
}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties
import org.springframework.boot.convert.DurationUnit
import java.time.Duration
import java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit

@ConfigurationProperties("my")
class MyProperties {

	@DurationUnit(ChronoUnit.SECONDS)
	var sessionTimeout = Duration.ofSeconds(30)

	var readTimeout = Duration.ofMillis(1000)

}

```

To specify a session timeout of 30 seconds, `30`, `PT30S` and `30s` are all equivalent.
A read timeout of 500ms can be specified in any of the following form: `500`, `PT0.5S` and `500ms`.

You can also use any of the supported units.
These are:

- `ns` for nanoseconds
- `us` for microseconds
- `ms` for milliseconds
- `s` for seconds
- `m` for minutes
- `h` for hours
- `d` for days

The default unit is milliseconds and can be overridden using [`@DurationUnit`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/convert/DurationUnit.html) as illustrated in the sample above.

If you prefer to use constructor binding, the same properties can be exposed, as shown in the following example:

#### Java

```java

> [!TIP]
> If you are upgrading a [`Long`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Long.html) property, make sure to define the unit (using [`@DurationUnit`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/convert/DurationUnit.html)) if it is not milliseconds.
> Doing so gives a transparent upgrade path while supporting a much richer format.

<a id="features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.conversion.periods"></a>

#### Converting Periods

In addition to durations, Spring Boot can also work with [`Period`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Period.html) type.
The following formats can be used in application properties:

- A regular `int` representation (using days as the default unit unless a [`@PeriodUnit`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/convert/PeriodUnit.html) has been specified)
- The standard ISO-8601 format [used by [`Period`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Period.html)](<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Period.html#parse(java.lang.CharSequence)>)
- A simpler format where the value and the unit pairs are coupled (`1y3d` means 1 year and 3 days)

The following units are supported with the simple format:

- `y` for years
- `m` for months
- `w` for weeks
- `d` for days

> [!NOTE]
> The [`Period`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Period.html) type never actually stores the number of weeks, it is a shortcut that means “7 days”.

<a id="features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.conversion.data-sizes"></a>

#### Converting Data Sizes

Spring Framework has a [`DataSize`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/unit/DataSize.html) value type that expresses a size in bytes.
If you expose a [`DataSize`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/unit/DataSize.html) property, the following formats in application properties are available:

- A regular `long` representation (using bytes as the default unit unless a [`@DataSizeUnit`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/convert/DataSizeUnit.html) has been specified)
- A more readable format where the value and the unit are coupled (`10MB` means 10 megabytes)

Consider the following example:

#### Java

```java
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;
import org.springframework.boot.convert.DataSizeUnit;
import org.springframework.util.unit.DataSize;
import org.springframework.util.unit.DataUnit;

@ConfigurationProperties("my")
public class MyProperties {

	@DataSizeUnit(DataUnit.MEGABYTES)
	private DataSize bufferSize = DataSize.ofMegabytes(2);

	private DataSize sizeThreshold = DataSize.ofBytes(512);
	public DataSize getBufferSize() {
		return this.bufferSize;
	}

	public void setBufferSize(DataSize bufferSize) {
		this.bufferSize = bufferSize;
	}

	public DataSize getSizeThreshold() {
		return this.sizeThreshold;
	}

	public void setSizeThreshold(DataSize sizeThreshold) {
		this.sizeThreshold = sizeThreshold;
	}
}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties
import org.springframework.boot.convert.DataSizeUnit
import org.springframework.util.unit.DataSize
import org.springframework.util.unit.DataUnit

@ConfigurationProperties("my")
class MyProperties {

	@DataSizeUnit(DataUnit.MEGABYTES)
	var bufferSize = DataSize.ofMegabytes(2)

	var sizeThreshold = DataSize.ofBytes(512)

}

```

To specify a buffer size of 10 megabytes, `10` and `10MB` are equivalent.
A size threshold of 256 bytes can be specified as `256` or `256B`.

You can also use any of the supported units.
These are:

- `B` for bytes
- `KB` for kilobytes
- `MB` for megabytes
- `GB` for gigabytes
- `TB` for terabytes

The default unit is bytes and can be overridden using [`@DataSizeUnit`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/convert/DataSizeUnit.html) as illustrated in the sample above.

If you prefer to use constructor binding, the same properties can be exposed, as shown in the following example:

#### Java

```java
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.bind.DefaultValue;
import org.springframework.boot.convert.DataSizeUnit;
import org.springframework.util.unit.DataSize;
import org.springframework.util.unit.DataUnit;

@ConfigurationProperties("my")
public class MyProperties {
	private final DataSize bufferSize;

	private final DataSize sizeThreshold;
	public MyProperties(@DataSizeUnit(DataUnit.MEGABYTES) @DefaultValue("2MB") DataSize bufferSize,
			@DefaultValue("512B") DataSize sizeThreshold) {
		this.bufferSize = bufferSize;
		this.sizeThreshold = sizeThreshold;
	}
	public DataSize getBufferSize() {
		return this.bufferSize;
	}

	public DataSize getSizeThreshold() {
		return this.sizeThreshold;
	}
}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.bind.DefaultValue
import org.springframework.boot.convert.DataSizeUnit
import org.springframework.util.unit.DataSize
import org.springframework.util.unit.DataUnit

@ConfigurationProperties("my")
class MyProperties(@param:DataSizeUnit(DataUnit.MEGABYTES) @param:DefaultValue("2MB") val bufferSize: DataSize,
		@param:DefaultValue("512B") val sizeThreshold: DataSize)

```

> [!TIP]
> If you are upgrading a [`Long`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Long.html) property, make sure to define the unit (using [`@DataSizeUnit`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/convert/DataSizeUnit.html)) if it is not bytes.

<a id="features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.conversion.base64"></a>

#### Converting Base64 Data

Spring Boot supports resolving binary data that have been Base64 encoded.
If you expose a `Resource` property, the base64 encoded text can be provided as the value with a `base64:` prefix, as shown in the following example:

#### Properties

```properties
my.property=base64:SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ=
```

#### YAML

```yaml
my:
  property: base64:SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ=
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `Resource` property can also be used to provide the path to the resource, making it more versatile.

<a id="features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.validation"></a>

### @ConfigurationProperties Validation

Spring Boot attempts to validate [`@ConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html) classes whenever they are annotated with Spring’s [`@Validated`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/annotation/Validated.html) annotation.
You can use JSR-303 `jakarta.validation` constraint annotations directly on your configuration class.
To do so, ensure that a compliant JSR-303 implementation is on your classpath and then add constraint annotations to your fields, as shown in the following example:

#### Java

```java
import java.net.InetAddress;

import jakarta.validation.constraints.NotNull;

import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;
import org.springframework.validation.annotation.Validated;

@ConfigurationProperties("my.service")
@Validated
public class MyProperties {

	@NotNull
	private InetAddress remoteAddress;
	public InetAddress getRemoteAddress() {
		return this.remoteAddress;
	}

	public void setRemoteAddress(InetAddress remoteAddress) {
		this.remoteAddress = remoteAddress;
	}
}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
import jakarta.validation.constraints.NotNull
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties
import org.springframework.validation.annotation.Validated
import java.net.InetAddress

@ConfigurationProperties("my.service")
@Validated
class MyProperties {

	var remoteAddress: @NotNull InetAddress? = null

}

```

> [!TIP]
> You can also trigger validation by annotating the [`@Bean`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Bean.html) method that creates the configuration properties with [`@Validated`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/annotation/Validated.html).

To cascade validation to nested properties the associated field must be annotated with [`@Valid`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/bean-validation/3.1/apidocs/jakarta/validation/Valid.html).
The following example builds on the preceding `MyProperties` example:

#### Java

```java
import java.net.InetAddress;

import jakarta.validation.Valid;
import jakarta.validation.constraints.NotEmpty;
import jakarta.validation.constraints.NotNull;

import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;
import org.springframework.validation.annotation.Validated;

@ConfigurationProperties("my.service")
@Validated
public class MyProperties {

	@NotNull
	private InetAddress remoteAddress;

	@Valid
	private final Security security = new Security();
	public InetAddress getRemoteAddress() {
		return this.remoteAddress;
	}

	public void setRemoteAddress(InetAddress remoteAddress) {
		this.remoteAddress = remoteAddress;
	}

	public Security getSecurity() {
		return this.security;
	}
	public static class Security {

		@NotEmpty
		private String username;
		public String getUsername() {
			return this.username;
		}

		public void setUsername(String username) {
			this.username = username;
		}
	}

}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
import jakarta.validation.Valid
import jakarta.validation.constraints.NotEmpty
import jakarta.validation.constraints.NotNull
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties
import org.springframework.validation.annotation.Validated
import java.net.InetAddress

@ConfigurationProperties("my.service")
@Validated
class MyProperties {

	var remoteAddress: @NotNull InetAddress? = null

	@Valid
	val security = Security()

	class Security {

		@NotEmpty
		var username: String? = null

	}

}

```

You can also add a custom Spring [`Validator`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/Validator.html) by creating a bean definition called `configurationPropertiesValidator`.
The [`@Bean`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Bean.html) method should be declared `static`.
The configuration properties validator is created very early in the application’s lifecycle, and declaring the [`@Bean`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Bean.html) method as static lets the bean be created without having to instantiate the [`@Configuration`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Configuration.html) class.
Doing so avoids any problems that may be caused by early instantiation.

> [!TIP]
> The `spring-boot-actuator` module includes an endpoint that exposes all [`@ConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html) beans.
> Point your web browser to `/actuator/configprops` or use the equivalent JMX endpoint.
> See the [Production ready features](../actuator/endpoints.md) section for details.

### @ConfigurationProperties vs. @Value

The [`@Value`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Value.html) annotation is a core container feature, and it does not provide the same features as type-safe configuration properties.
The following table summarizes the features that are supported by [`@ConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html) and [`@Value`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Value.html):

| Feature | `@ConfigurationProperties` | `@Value` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Relaxed binding](#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding) | Yes | Limited (see [note below](#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.vs-value-annotation.note)) |
| [Meta-data support](../../specification/configuration-metadata/index.md) | Yes | No |
| `SpEL` evaluation | No | Yes |

<a id="features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.vs-value-annotation.note"></a>

> [!NOTE]
> If you do want to use [`@Value`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Value.html), we recommend that you refer to property names using their canonical form (kebab-case using only lowercase letters).
> This will allow Spring Boot to use the same logic as it does when [relaxed binding](#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties.relaxed-binding) [`@ConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html).
>
> For example, `@Value("${demo.item-price}")` will pick up `demo.item-price` and `demo.itemPrice` forms from the `application.properties` file, as well as `DEMO_ITEMPRICE` from the system environment.
> If you use `@Value("${demo.itemPrice}")` instead, it will pickup the `demo.itemPrice` form from the `application.properties` file, as well as `DEMO_ITEMPRICE` from the system environment, but `demo.item-price` would not be considered.

If you define a set of configuration keys for your own components, we recommend you group them in a POJO annotated with [`@ConfigurationProperties`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.1.1/api/java/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html).
Doing so will provide you with structured, type-safe object that you can inject into your own beans.

`SpEL` expressions from  [application property files](#features.external-config.files) are not processed at time of parsing these files and populating the environment.
However, it is possible to write a `SpEL` expression in [`@Value`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Value.html).
If the value of a property from an application property file is a `SpEL` expression, it will be evaluated when consumed through [`@Value`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Value.html).
