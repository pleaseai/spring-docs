# WebSockets

Spring Boot provides WebSockets auto-configuration for embedded Tomcat and Jetty.
If you deploy a war file to a standalone container, Spring Boot assumes that the container is responsible for the configuration of its WebSocket support.

Spring Framework provides [rich WebSocket support](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/7.0/web/websocket.html) for MVC web applications that can be easily accessed through the `spring-boot-starter-websocket` module.

WebSocket support is also available for [reactive web applications](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/7.0/web/webflux-websocket.html) and requires to include the WebSocket API alongside `spring-boot-starter-webflux`:

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>jakarta.websocket</groupId>
	<artifactId>jakarta.websocket-api</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
