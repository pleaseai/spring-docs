# Running a Test as a User in Spring MVC Test

It is often desirable to run tests as a specific user.
There are two simple ways to populate the user:

- [Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with RequestPostProcessor](#test-mockmvc-securitycontextholder-rpp)
- [Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with Annotations](#test-mockmvc-withmockuser)

## Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with RequestPostProcessor

You have a number of options to associate a user to the current `HttpServletRequest`.
The following example runs as a user (which does not need to exist) whose username is `user`, whose password is `password`, and whose role is `ROLE_USER`:

#### Java

```java
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(user("user")))
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
mvc.get("/") {
    with(user("user"))
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The support works by associating the user to the `HttpServletRequest`.
> To associate the request to the `SecurityContextHolder`, you need to ensure that the `SecurityContextPersistenceFilter` is associated with the `MockMvc` instance.
> You can do so in a number of ways:
>
> - Invoking [`apply(springSecurity())`](setup.md#test-mockmvc-setup)
> - Adding Spring Security’s `FilterChainProxy` to `MockMvc`
> - Manually adding `SecurityContextPersistenceFilter` to the `MockMvc` instance may make sense when using `MockMvcBuilders.standaloneSetup`

You can easily make customizations.
For example, the following will run as a user (which does not need to exist) with the username "admin", the password "pass", and the roles "ROLE\_USER" and "ROLE\_ADMIN".

#### Java

```java
mvc
	.perform(get("/admin").with(user("admin").password("pass").roles("USER","ADMIN")))
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
mvc.get("/admin") {
    with(user("admin").password("pass").roles("USER","ADMIN"))
}
```

If you have a custom `UserDetails` that you would like to use, you can easily specify that as well.
For example, the following will use the specified `UserDetails` (which does not need to exist) to run with a `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` that has a principal of the specified `UserDetails`:

#### Java

```java
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(user(userDetails)))
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
mvc.get("/") {
    with(user(userDetails))
}
```

You can run as anonymous user using the following:

#### Java

```java
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(anonymous()))
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
mvc.get("/") {
    with(anonymous())
}
```

This is especially useful if you are running with a default user and wish to process a few requests as an anonymous user.

If you want a custom `Authentication` (which does not need to exist) you can do so using the following:

#### Java

```java
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(authentication(authentication)))
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
mvc.get("/") {
    with(authentication(authentication))
}
```

You can even customize the `SecurityContext` using the following:

#### Java

```java
mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(securityContext(securityContext)))
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
mvc.get("/") {
    with(securityContext(securityContext))
}
```

We can also ensure to run as a specific user for every request by using `MockMvcBuilders`'s default request.
For example, the following will run as a user (which does not need to exist) with the username "admin", the password "password", and the role "ROLE\_ADMIN":

#### Java

```java
mvc = MockMvcBuilders
		.webAppContextSetup(context)
		.defaultRequest(get("/").with(user("user").roles("ADMIN")))
		.apply(springSecurity())
		.build();
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
mvc = MockMvcBuilders
    .webAppContextSetup(context)
    .defaultRequest<DefaultMockMvcBuilder>(get("/").with(user("user").roles("ADMIN")))
    .apply<DefaultMockMvcBuilder>(springSecurity())
    .build()
```

If you find you are using the same user in many of your tests, it is recommended to move the user to a method.
For example, you can specify the following in your own class named `CustomSecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors`:

#### Java

```java
public static RequestPostProcessor rob() {
	return user("rob").roles("ADMIN");
}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
fun rob(): RequestPostProcessor {
    return user("rob").roles("ADMIN")
}
```

Now you can perform a static import on `CustomSecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors` and use that within your tests:

#### Java

```java
import static sample.CustomSecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors.*;

...

mvc
	.perform(get("/").with(rob()))
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
import sample.CustomSecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors.*

//...

mvc.get("/") {
    with(rob())
}
```

## Running as a User in Spring MVC Test with Annotations

As an alternative to using a `RequestPostProcessor` to create your user, you can use annotations described in [Testing Method Security](../method.md).
For example, the following will run the test with the user with username "user", password "password", and role "ROLE\_USER":

#### Java

```java
@Test
@WithMockUser
public void requestProtectedUrlWithUser() throws Exception {
mvc
		.perform(get("/"))
		...
}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
@Test
@WithMockUser
fun requestProtectedUrlWithUser() {
    mvc
        .get("/")
        // ...
}
```

Alternatively, the following will run the test with the user with username "user", password "password", and role "ROLE\_ADMIN":

#### Java

```java
@Test
@WithMockUser(roles="ADMIN")
public void requestProtectedUrlWithUser() throws Exception {
mvc
		.perform(get("/"))
		...
}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
@Test
@WithMockUser(roles = ["ADMIN"])
fun requestProtectedUrlWithUser() {
    mvc
        .get("/")
        // ...
}
```
