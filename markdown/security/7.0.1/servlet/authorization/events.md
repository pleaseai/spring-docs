# Authorization Events

For each authorization that is denied, an `AuthorizationDeniedEvent` is fired.
Also, it’s possible to fire an `AuthorizationGrantedEvent` for authorizations that are granted.

To listen for these events, you must first publish an `AuthorizationEventPublisher`.

Spring Security’s `SpringAuthorizationEventPublisher` will probably do fine.
It comes publishes authorization events using Spring’s `ApplicationEventPublisher`:

#### Java

```java
@Bean
public AuthorizationEventPublisher authorizationEventPublisher
        (ApplicationEventPublisher applicationEventPublisher) {
    return new SpringAuthorizationEventPublisher(applicationEventPublisher);
}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
@Bean
fun authorizationEventPublisher
        (applicationEventPublisher: ApplicationEventPublisher?): AuthorizationEventPublisher {
    return SpringAuthorizationEventPublisher(applicationEventPublisher)
}
```

Then, you can use Spring’s `@EventListener` support:

#### Java

```java
@Component
public class AuthenticationEvents {

    @EventListener
    public void onFailure(AuthorizationDeniedEvent failure) {
		// ...
    }
}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
@Component
class AuthenticationEvents {

    @EventListener
    fun onFailure(failure: AuthorizationDeniedEvent?) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Authorization Granted Events

Because `AuthorizationGrantedEvent`s have the potential to be quite noisy, they are not published by default.

In fact, publishing these events will likely require some business logic on your part to ensure that your application is not inundated with noisy authorization events.

You can provide your own predicate that filters success events.
For example, the following publisher only publishes authorization grants where `ROLE_ADMIN` was required:

#### Java

```java
@Bean
AuthorizationEventPublisher authorizationEventPublisher() {
    SpringAuthorizationEventPublisher eventPublisher = new SpringAuthorizationEventPublisher();
    eventPublisher.setShouldPublishEvent((result) -> {
        if (!result.isGranted()) {
            return true;
        }
        if (result instanceof AuthorityAuthorizationDecision decision) {
            Collection<GrantedAuthority> authorities = decision.getAuthorities();
            return AuthorityUtils.authorityListToSet(authorities).contains("ROLE_ADMIN");
        }
        return false;
    });
    return eventPublisher;
}
```

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
@Bean
fun authorizationEventPublisher(): AuthorizationEventPublisher {
    val eventPublisher = SpringAuthorizationEventPublisher()
    eventPublisher.setShouldPublishEvent { (result) ->
        if (!result.isGranted()) {
            return true
        }
        if (decision is AuthorityAuthorizationDecision) {
            val authorities = decision.getAuthorities()
            return AuthorityUtils.authorityListToSet(authorities).contains("ROLE_ADMIN")
        }
        return false
    }
    return eventPublisher
}
```
